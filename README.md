# 🌍 SCUPI Earthquake Early Warning System (EEW)

**Project Overview**  
The **SCUPI Earthquake Early Warning System** is a public-oriented seismic alert platform developed by the Sichuan University – Pittsburgh Institute. It is designed to provide intuitive, timely, and reliable alerts and information before earthquakes strike, helping users make quick, informed decisions to ensure safety and effective emergency response.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🔴 **Prioritized Emergency Alerts**  
  High-risk seismic alerts are displayed at the top with red highlights and bold magnified magnitudes, ensuring users immediately grasp the critical information.

- 📊 **Real-Time Data Visualization**  
  Earthquake data is visualized through charts and time-series trends, color-coded by intensity (orange, red, green) to help users distinguish between isolated quakes and ongoing seismic activity.

- 📞 **Minimalist Emergency Interaction**  
  One-tap emergency calls are supported, with color-coded categories (e.g., fire, medical) to reduce panic-driven misclicks and enhance psychological security.

- 🗺️ **Location & Shelter Recommendations**  
  A live shelter map offers suggestions based on proximity, complete with details like capacity, supplies, and contact info—answering the critical questions: *Where am I? Where is safe?*

- ♿ **Accessibility & Customization**  
  Features include adjustable font size, vibration alerts, and dark mode to support elderly and visually impaired users. Users can also mute low-level alerts to reduce information fatigue.

- 📚 **Education & Drill Mode**  
  An earthquake preparedness guide and simulation drills are integrated to boost public awareness and readiness.
